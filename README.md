# AI-Based-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
The AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a Python-based cybersecurity project designed to detect malicious activities and unauthorized access in a network using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. This system analyzes network traffic data to identify potential intrusions such as DoS attacks, probing, unauthorized access, and abnormal behavior patterns.

The project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to classify network traffic as normal or intrusive. Data preprocessing techniques such as feature selection, normalization, and labeling are applied to improve detection accuracy. The trained model helps in real-time or offline detection of network threats by predicting suspicious traffic patterns.

This system enhances network security by providing early threat detection, reducing manual monitoring efforts, and improving response time against cyber attacks. The project demonstrates practical implementation of AI in cybersecurity and is suitable for academic, learning, and research purposes.
